# UK Rail Icons for OpenRailwayMap

Below is a table of icons for the proposed tagging of railway signals in the UK, these icons have been created by the author and exist as both PNGs and SVGs.

The tags themselves are discussed within the tag proposal catalog [here](https://github.com/artemis-beta/ukosmrailtags/blob/master/Catalog.md).
